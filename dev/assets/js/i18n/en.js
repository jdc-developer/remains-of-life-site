		'biography-content-1': 'Remains of Life is a one-man band from São Paulo – SP, Brazil founded by the musician and producer Jorge Silva. After small amateur projects between friends, amongst these, the so called Illuriah and Tribal Blood, Silva decided to create his own musical project in order to achieve his artistic ambitions.',
		'biography-content-2': 'Mixing old and new compositions, Remains of Life was idealized towards the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, when Silva started the compositions and recordings in his home. After much work and many trials, Silva concluded the first album of the band, which is the full-length Pilgrimage.',
		'biography-content-3': 'Pilgrimage is a partially conceptual album. It doesn’t necessarily relates the events of a story or of a character outlined in archetypes, but instead, it is a great mixture of progressive feelings, which all of those were factually felt by the author, and he describes them in the work; throughout an imaginative persona playing the role of a conceptual character, creating abstract images to represent the obstacles and the shapes of those feelings.',
		'biography-content-4': 'The album sonority mingles the most variated extreme metal arrangements. The guitars, present themselves with remarkable harmonic lines, and other heavy, straight and extremely technical lines; the nylon guitar, one of the author passions, is shown up brilliant and intense in many moments of the work; and the voices vary from the most poignant growling to the most lofty melodic and harmonic.',
		'biography-content-5': 'The project’s concept is to relate feelings and situations under metaphoric optics without losing their essence and without these being necessarily felt and lived by the author, but also comprehended and expanded by him; all of this through the musical art. For such a reason, the project has been entitled Remains of Life, for what remains of a life but memories and feelings?',

		'new-single-content-1': 'Remains of Life announces its brand new single, Shattered Mirror. This song was the first composition of the project founder, Jorge Silva. Its original arrangements, created long before the band\'s conception, took short passages through the first bands which Silva featured in. Being his first work, this one received a special care from its author, being invariably chosen to feature as the unique single from Remains of Life\'s debut album.',
		'new-single-content-2': 'Shattered Mirror is a slow and exceptionally melancholic song, even for the high dramatic standards of the upcoming album. Its pacing goes through melodic phrases and intense and explosive guitar arrangements. You may listen to it on the main digital platforms and on the band\'s YouTube channel from 21/10/2021 and on, where we will upload an amazing lyric video produced by Wolff Videomaker. We wish to thank Alef Marra for the cover art, Marcel Briani for the art editing and Victor Zavinsck for the logo drawing. You can watch the teaser of the lyric video below:',
