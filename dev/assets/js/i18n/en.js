		'biography-content-1': 'Remains of Life is a one-man band from São Paulo – SP, Brazil founded by musician and producer Jorge Silva. After small amateur projects between friends, amongst these, the so called Illuriah and Tribal Blood, Jorge Silva decided to create his own musical project in order to achieve his artistic ambitions.',
		'biography-content-2': 'Mixing old and new compositions, Remains of Life was idealized towards the end of 2018 and the start of 2019, when Jorge started the compositions and recordings in his home. After much work and many trials,  Jorge concluded the first work of the band, which is the full-length album Pilgrimage.',
		'biography-content-3': 'Pilgrimage is a partially conceptual album. It doesn’t necessarily relates the events of a story outlined in archetypes, or of a character, but instead, it is a great mixture of progressive feelings, which all of those, were factually felt by the author, and he describes them in the work; throughout an imaginative persona playing the role of a conceptual character, creating abstract images to represent the obstacles and the shapes of those feelings.',
		'biography-content-4': 'The album sonority mingles the most variated extreme metal arrangements. The guitars, present themselves with remarkable harmonic lines, and other heavy, straight and extremely technical lines; the nylon guitar, one of the author passions, is shown up brilliant and intense in many moments of the work; and the voices vary from the most poignant growling to the most lofty melodic and harmonic.',
		'biography-content-5': 'The project’s concept is to relate feelings and situations under abstract optics without losing their essence, and without them being necessarily felt by the author, but also comprehended and expanded by him. All of this through the musical art. That is why the project has been entitled Remains of Life, for what remains of a life but memories and feelings?',
